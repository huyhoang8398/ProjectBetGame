# III. Programs, Materials, Architecture

In this project, we use IntellIJ with Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) with GlassFish5 to build the web application, beside that, we also use some library for making an responsive website such as Boostrap and NES css to quickly design and customize responsive for front-end part. 

A clean codebase is always a pleasure to work with. A well organized codebase is easy to maintain, is robust, performs well, is testable and is self-documenting. In order to do that, the application will be written by using MVC - short for Model-View-Controller design pattern and also we use JSF alongside with javaEE.

## Use-cases

![Use-case diagram](use-cases.png){ width=60% }

As the aim of this project is to create a football bet platform. The application has three main characters which is Normal User, Administrator and Bookmaker.

The administrator has the role to create a bookmaker and assign them with a real football match ( which is fetch from [Football API](https://www.football-data.org/)) and also can handle basic user data information or delete user account.

The client can browse all the available match which was hosted by administrator and a bookmaker and place a bet on it They also can edit their bet later.

The application service later will fetch the result of these match and update the user money based their bet result. And also, every time there is a new match which is available for bet, our service application will send an message announcing to user through twitter. And also we use twitter notification to announce the match result which is an advance feature.
